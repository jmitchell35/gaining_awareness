## Java Alternatives on the JVM

The JVM hosts multiple languages besides Java:

| Language | Key Characteristics | Primary Use Cases |
|----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Kotlin | Concise, interoperable with Java, null safety | Android, server-side, multiplatform |
| Scala | Functional programming, strong type system | Big data, distributed systems |
| Groovy | Dynamic typing, scripting capabilities | Scripting, DSLs, Gradle |
| Clojure | Lisp dialect, functional programming | Data analysis, concurrency |
| JRuby | Ruby implementation for JVM | Ruby applications needing JVM integration |
| Jython | Python implementation for JVM | Python code needing Java libraries |

## Introduction to Java

Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in 1995. Its primary strength comes from its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) philosophy, enabled by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

| Java Feature | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Platform Independence | Code runs on any device with a JVM |
| Object-Oriented | Based on classes and objects |
| Strongly Typed | Variable types are explicitly declared |
| Automatic Memory Management | Garbage collection handles memory |
| Rich Standard Library | Comprehensive built-in APIs |
| Backward Compatibility | Newer versions maintain compatibility with older code |

### Java Versions

| Version | Release Year | Key Features |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Java 8 (LTS) | 2014 | Lambda expressions, Stream API, Date/Time API |
| Java 11 (LTS) | 2018 | HTTP Client, Local-variable syntax for lambda |
| Java 17 (LTS) | 2021 | Sealed classes, Pattern matching for switch |
| Java 21 (LTS) | 2023 | Virtual threads, Record patterns, String templates |

### Understanding the JDK

**JDK** stands for **Java Development Kit**. It is a software package that provides everything you need to develop Java applications:

1. **Development Tools**: Includes the compiler (`javac`), debugger (`jdb`), documentation generator (`javadoc`), and other utilities needed to create Java programs
2. **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Contains the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and standard libraries needed to run Java applications
3. **Core Libraries**: A comprehensive set of pre-written code that provides common functionality

In simpler terms, the JDK is what developers install on their computers to write, compile, and test Java programs. If you want to create Java applications, you need a JDK installed.

Different versions of the JDK correspond to different versions of Java. For example, JDK 17 contains tools and libraries for developing with Java 17 features.

## Java Application Domains: Beyond Web Development

### Is Java Web-Oriented or Software-Oriented?

Java is equally prominent in both web development and traditional software development. Unlike some languages that are primarily designed for one domain (like PHP for web), Java has strong adoption across multiple domains:

#### Web Development
- Enterprise web applications
- RESTful APIs and microservices
- E-commerce platforms
- Content management systems
- Web portals

#### Desktop Software

### Implementations

#### What Are "Implementations" in Java?

In the Java world, an "implementation" refers to software that fulfills the requirements of a specification or standard. Java has many specifications (like Jakarta EE) that define APIs, behaviors, and features, but don't provide actual code. Implementations are the concrete products created by various vendors that put these specifications into practice.

Think of specifications as blueprints, while implementations are the actual buildings constructed from those blueprints. Different vendors can create their own implementations of the same specification, often with unique features or optimizations beyond the basic requirements.

#### Jakarta EE Implementations

These are some of the major implementations of the Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE) specifications:

- **WildFly** (Red Hat): Open-source application server
- **GlassFish** (Eclipse Foundation): Reference implementation (the "official" example)
- **TomEE** (Apache): Tomcat with added EE components
- **Payara** (Payara Foundation): Derived from GlassFish
- **WebSphere Liberty** (IBM): Lightweight profile of WebSphere
- **Open Liberty** (Open Source): Open-source version of WebSphere Liberty

Each implementation can be certified to confirm it properly implements the specification, giving developers confidence in compatibility.

### IDE Integrations

Most Java IDEs have built-in static analysis capabilities and can integrate with the tools mentioned above:

- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Built-in inspections and integrations with most linters and quality tools
- **Eclipse**: Has the "Clean Code" feature and plugins for various quality tools
- **NetBeans**: Built-in static code analysis and Hint system
- **VS Code**: Extensions for Java linting and quality checks

### Integration with Build Tools

Quality tools can be integrated with build systems for automated checks:

```xml
<!-- Example Maven integration for Checkstyle -->
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-checkstyle-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.0</version>
    <configuration>
        <configLocation>google_checks.xml</configLocation>
        <failsOnError>true</failsOnError>
        <consoleOutput>true</consoleOutput>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>check</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

### Common Quality Control Workflow

In a professional Java development environment, code quality tools are typically used in the following ways:

1. **Local Development**: Developers run linters in their IDEs to catch issues early
2. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Git hooks can run checks before code is committed
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated builds run comprehensive quality checks
4. **Code Reviews**: Quality metrics are used during peer reviews
5. **Quality Gates**: SonarQube or similar tools can block merges if quality thresholds aren't met

### Choosing the Right Tools

For beginners, start with:
- **Checkstyle**: For enforcing coding standards
- **SpotBugs**: For finding potential bugs
- **JaCoCo**: For measuring test coverage

For enterprise environments, consider a more comprehensive setup with SonarQube, which integrates multiple quality aspects into a single platform.

## Java Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for Java-specific terminology and concepts that you'll encounter as you learn and work with Java. Understanding these terms will help you navigate documentation, tutorials, and discussions in the Java community.

### A

**Abstract Class**: A class that cannot be instantiated and is often used as a base for other classes. It may contain abstract methods (without implementation) that subclasses must implement.

**Access Modifier**: Keywords that determine the accessibility of classes, methods, and fields. Java has four: `public`, `protected`, `private`, and default (no keyword, also called "package-private").

**Annotation**: A form of metadata that provides data about a program that is not part of the program itself. Annotations start with `@` (e.g., `@Override`).

**AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)**: Programming paradigm that increases modularity by allowing separation of cross-cutting concerns. Spring AOP is a popular implementation.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of definitions, protocols, and tools for building software. Java has a rich set of APIs in its standard library.

**Applet**: A small Java program that can be embedded in a web page. Note: Applets are deprecated in modern Java.
