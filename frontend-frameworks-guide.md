# Modern Web Development: A Guide to CSS and JavaScript Frameworks

## Introduction

The modern web development ecosystem is rich with frameworks and libraries designed to make developers more productive. This guide aims to provide clarity on the most popular CSS and JavaScript tools, their use cases, and when you might choose one over another.

**First, regarding your question about vanilla CSS/JS versus frameworks:**

You can absolutely be a legitimate developer using vanilla CSS and JavaScript. In fact, having a strong foundation in these fundamentals is extremely valuable. However, familiarity with at least one major framework in each category (CSS and JavaScript) will generally be expected for most professional roles in 2025.

## CSS Frameworks and Libraries

| Framework | Market Share | Learning Curve | Best Use Cases | Key Features |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Tailwind CSS** | High (growing rapidly) | Medium | Highly customized UIs, modern applications | Utility-first approach, extensive customization, responsive design |
| **Bootstrap** | Very High | Low | Rapid prototyping, business applications, consistent UI | Component-based, responsive grid, extensive pre-built components |
| **Bulma** | Medium | Low | Clean modern interfaces, simpler projects | Flexbox-based, modular, no JavaScript dependencies |
| **Foundation** | Medium | Medium | Enterprise applications, complex responsive layouts | Advanced grid system, accessibility features, email templates |
| **Pure CSS** | Low | Very Low | Lightweight projects, performance-critical applications | Minimal file size, modular approach |
| **Sass/SCSS** | Very High (preprocessor) | Low | Any CSS project that benefits from variables and nesting | Variables, nesting, mixins, functions, modular architecture |
| **Tachyons** | Low | Low | Projects prioritizing performance, atomic design | Atomic CSS approach, small file size, highly composable |

### CSS Frameworks: Deeper Insights

#### Tailwind CSS
- **Adoption**: Extremely popular for modern web applications
- **Philosophy**: Utility-first approach where you compose designs by applying pre-existing utility classes directly in your HTML (e.g., `class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-500"` instead of creating custom CSS classes)
- **Advantages**: Highly customizable, no need to write custom CSS or create class names, consistent spacing and color systems
- **Disadvantages**: HTML can become verbose with many classes, initial learning curve
- **When to choose**: When you want complete design control but still want development speed

#### Bootstrap
- **Adoption**: The most widely used CSS framework globally
- **Philosophy**: Provides pre-designed components and a grid system that you can use out of the box
- **Advantages**: Fast development, consistent design, extensive documentation, large community
- **Disadvantages**: Sites can look "Bootstrap-y" without customization, larger file size
- **When to choose**: When rapid development is a priority and you're comfortable with the Bootstrap aesthetic

#### Sass/SCSS
- **Note**: This is a CSS preprocessor rather than a framework (adds programming-like features to CSS that get compiled into regular CSS)
- **Adoption**: Industry standard CSS enhancement
- **Advantages**: Makes CSS more maintainable with variables, nesting, and functions
- **When to choose**: Can be used alongside any CSS framework or vanilla CSS

#### Tachyons
- **Note**: One of the original atomic CSS frameworks that influenced Tailwind
- **Philosophy**: Strictly follows atomic design principles where each class does exactly one thing
- **Advantages**: Very small file size, highly performant, strong composition abilities
- **Disadvantages**: Less modern features than Tailwind, smaller community
- **When to choose**: For projects where file size and performance are critical priorities

## Component-Based vs. Modular Approaches

To better understand the different approaches to web development, let's clarify two important concepts:

### Component-Based Design

**Component-based design** refers to breaking down a user interface into reusable, self-contained pieces (components) that encapsulate their own HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript behavior. This approach is fundamental to modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.

Key characteristics of component-based design:

- **Self-contained**: Components include everything they need to function
- **Reusable**: Components can be used in multiple places in an application
- **Hierarchical**: Complex components can be built from simpler components
- **Encapsulated**: Internal implementation details are hidden from other components

Contrary to potentially limiting customization, component-based design actually **enhances customization** through:

1. **Props/Parameters**: Components accept inputs that modify their appearance and behavior
2. **Composition**: Smaller components can be combined in countless ways
3. **Extension**: Base components can be extended for specialized uses
4. **Theming**: Global style variables can transform component appearance

Examples of component-based frameworks:
- React, Vue, Angular (JavaScript frameworks)
- Bootstrap, Material-UI (UI component libraries)

### Modular Approach

A **modular approach** refers to organizing code into independent, interchangeable modules that each handle a specific functionality. This can apply to both CSS and JavaScript.

Key characteristics of modular approaches:

- **Separation of concerns**: Different modules handle different aspects of functionality
- **Independent**: Modules can work independently of each other
- **Combinable**: Developers can include only the modules they need
- **Maintainable**: Changes to one module don't affect others

In CSS frameworks:
- **Component-based CSS frameworks** (like Bootstrap) provide pre-designed components with both structure and styling
- **Utility-first CSS frameworks** (like Tailwind) provide small, single-purpose utility classes to combine
- **Atomic CSS frameworks** (like Tachyons) take the utility-first approach to its logical extreme, with each class doing exactly one thing

### Utility-first vs. Atomic CSS

While these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, there are subtle differences:

| Aspect | Utility-first (Tailwind) | Atomic CSS (Tachyons) |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **Class purpose** | Mostly one property per class | Strictly one property per class |
| **Design system** | Works within a configurable design system | More focused on composition than design system |
| **Generation** | Pre-defined utility classes | Originally focused on programmatically generated classes |
| **Responsive design** | Built-in responsive utilities and variants | Basic responsive utilities |
| **Current popularity** | Very high, growing | Lower, pioneered concepts now in Tailwind |

### Component-Based vs. Modular: Clarifying the Difference

The confusion often stems from how these terms are used in different contexts:

| Aspect | Component-Based | Modular |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Focus** | UI building blocks | Code organization |
| **Scope** | Primarily frontend | Any software aspect |
| **Customization** | High (through props, composition) | High (through module selection) |
| **Example in CSS** | `.card`, `.navbar` components | Separate files for typography, colors, layout |
| **Example in JS** | React components | JavaScript modules for authentication, data fetching, etc. |

**Important clarification**: Component-based design and modular approaches are not opposites—they're complementary concepts that can be used together. Modern web development typically uses:

1. Component-based UI architecture (React/Vue/Angular)
2. Modular organization of code (separate files/modules for different functionality)
3. Either component-based or utility-first CSS approaches (or a mixture)

Both approaches offer extensive customization options—they just provide different ways of organizing and thinking about that customization.

## JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries

| Framework | Market Share | Learning Curve | Best Use Cases | Key Features |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **React** | Very High | Medium | Single-page applications, complex UIs, large-scale applications | Component-based, virtual DOM, large ecosystem |
| **Vue.js** | High | Low | Progressive web apps, medium complexity applications, augmenting existing sites | Gentle learning curve, flexible integration, template-based |
| **Angular** | High | High | Enterprise applications, large teams, applications requiring strict patterns | Complete framework, TypeScript integration, RxJS, dependency injection |
| **Svelte** | Medium (growing) | Low | Performance-critical applications, smaller applications | Compile-time framework, less boilerplate, smaller bundle sizes |
| **Alpine.js** | Low-Medium | Very Low | Simple interactivity, enhancing server-rendered HTML | Lightweight, minimal API, works well with traditional backends |
| **jQuery** | High (declining) | Very Low | Legacy applications, simple DOM manipulation | Easy DOM manipulation, cross-browser compatibility |
| **Next.js** | High | Medium | React applications requiring SSR, complex React applications | Server-side rendering, file-based routing, build optimization |
| **Nuxt.js** | Medium | Medium | Vue applications requiring SSR, complex Vue applications | Server-side rendering for Vue, automated routing |

### JavaScript Frameworks: Deeper Insights

#### React
- **Adoption**: The most popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Philosophy**: Component-based architecture with a virtual DOM (a lightweight copy of the actual DOM that React uses to calculate the most efficient way to update the real DOM)
- **Advantages**: Vast ecosystem, strong community, highly performant for complex UIs
- **Disadvantages**: Requires additional libraries for full-featured applications (routing, state management)
- **When to choose**: For complex, interactive UIs, especially when you might need native mobile later (React Native)
- **Key concept**: Uses JSX (JavaScript XML) that looks like HTML within JavaScript

#### Vue.js
- **Adoption**: Widely adopted, especially popular with developers coming from jQuery or vanilla JS
- **Philosophy**: Progressive framework that can be adopted incrementally (can start with just a small part of your app)
- **Advantages**: Gentle learning curve, flexible (can be used for small parts of an app), comprehensive documentation
- **Disadvantages**: Smaller ecosystem than React, fewer job opportunities
- **When to choose**: When you want flexibility and a gentler introduction to modern JS frameworks
- **Key concept**: Uses HTML templates with special directives (e.g., `v-if`, `v-for`) to control rendering

#### Angular
- **Adoption**: Popular in enterprise environments and for large applications
- **Philosophy**: Complete framework with opinionated structure (provides a full solution with built-in tools)
- **Advantages**: Comprehensive solution (includes routing, forms, HTTP client), enforces best practices
- **Disadvantages**: Steeper learning curve, more verbose, heavier
- **When to choose**: For enterprise applications, when working with larger teams that benefit from enforced patterns
- **Key concept**: Uses TypeScript by default and a component structure with separate HTML templates

#### Alpine.js
- **Adoption**: Growing for smaller interactive components
- **Philosophy**: Minimal framework for adding JavaScript behavior to HTML
- **Advantages**: Extremely lightweight, simple syntax inspired by Vue, works well with server-rendered HTML
- **When to choose**: When you need to add light interactivity to a mostly static site

## Meta-Frameworks and Full-Stack Solutions

### What is a Meta-Framework?

A **meta-framework** is a framework built on top of another framework, extending its capabilities with additional features and conventions. Think of it as a "framework for a framework" that adds structure, functionality, and optimization that the base framework doesn't provide out of the box.

For example:
- **Next.js** is a meta-framework built on top of React
- **Nuxt.js** is a meta-framework built on top of Vue.js
- **SvelteKit** is a meta-framework built on top of Svelte

### What Meta-Frameworks Add to Base Frameworks

1. **Project Structure and Conventions**: Meta-frameworks provide opinionated directory structures and naming conventions that standardize how applications are built.

2. **Built-in Routing**: While base frameworks like React don't include routing systems, meta-frameworks typically provide file-based routing where the file structure automatically creates application routes.

3. **Rendering Strategies**: Meta-frameworks add different ways to render your application:
   - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Generating HTML on the server
   - **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-rendering pages at build time
   - **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**: Rendering in the browser (the default for base frameworks)
   - **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Updating static pages after they've been built

4. **Build Optimization**: Advanced asset optimization, code splitting, and bundling configurations.

5. **Development Experience**: Improved developer tools, hot reloading, and debugging capabilities.

### What "Full-Stack Focus" Means

A framework with "full-stack focus" provides tools for both frontend (what users see in the browser) and backend (server-side code, database interactions) development in a unified way. Traditional frameworks like React or Vue primarily handle just the frontend (UI) part of web development.

Full-stack meta-frameworks bridge this gap by offering:

1. **API Routes**: The ability to create backend API endpoints within the same project structure as your frontend code.
   - Example: In Next.js, putting a file in `pages/api/users.js` automatically creates a `/api/users` endpoint.

2. **Database Integrations**: Built-in or simplified ways to connect to databases.

3. **Server-Side Code**: The ability to write code that runs on the server, not just in the browser.

4. **Authentication Systems**: Built-in or easily integrated user authentication.

5. **Unified Deployment**: Deploy both frontend and backend together as a single application.

The key benefit is that developers can build complete applications without switching between separate frontend and backend codebases, using the same language (JavaScript/TypeScript) throughout the entire stack.

| Framework | Based On | Focus | Best Use Cases | Key Features |
|-----------|----------|-------|----------------|--------------|
| **Next.js** | React | Full-stack | Production React applications, SEO-focused sites | Server-side rendering, static site generation, API routes |
| **Nuxt.js** | Vue | Full-stack | Production Vue applications, SEO-focused sites | Similar to Next.js but for Vue |
| **Astro** | Agnostic | Content-focused | Content-heavy websites, blogs, documentation | Use any UI framework, partial hydration, content focus |
| **SvelteKit** | Svelte | Full-stack | Svelte production applications | File-based routing, SSR, deployment flexibility |
| **Remix** | React | Full-stack | Web applications with rich interactions | Nested routing, server rendering, progressive enhancement |

## Modern Component Libraries and Design Systems

When building web applications, you'll often want pre-designed components that you can customize to match your design needs. Here are some of the most popular component libraries and design systems in 2025:

### React-Based Component Libraries

| Library | Type | Customization | Best For | Key Features |
|---------|------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **shadcn/ui** | Component collection | High | Custom designs with production-ready components | Not a library but a collection of reusable components |
| **Material UI** | Complete design system | Medium | Google Material Design implementations | Comprehensive, mature ecosystem |
| **Chakra UI** | Component library | High | Accessible applications with custom design | Accessibility, composable components |
| **Ant Design** | Enterprise design system | Medium | Data-heavy enterprise applications | Data visualization, form controls |
| **React Bootstrap** | Bootstrap for React | Medium | Quick prototyping with familiar Bootstrap | Bootstrap components as React components |

### Vue-Based Component Libraries

| Library | Type | Customization | Best For | Key Features |
|---------|------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **Vuetify** | Material Design | Medium | Applications following Material Design | Comprehensive, well-documented |
| **PrimeVue** | Enterprise UI kit | High | Business applications | Rich set of components, themes |
| **Quasar** | Full framework | High | Cross-platform Vue applications | Native mobile, desktop and web support |

### Framework-Agnostic Libraries

| Library | Compatible With | Customization | Best For | Key Features |
|---------|----------------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **Radix UI** | React | Very High | Accessible, custom-designed components | Headless, accessibility-focused primitives |
| **Headless UI** | React, Vue | Very High | Completely custom styling with solid behavior | Unstyled, accessible component logic |

### Focus on shadcn/ui

**shadcn/ui** deserves special attention for your certification project as it represents a modern approach to component libraries:

- **What it is**: Not a traditional component library you install via npm, but a collection of reusable components built with Radix UI and styled with Tailwind CSS
- **Installation**: Components are copied directly into your project, using a CLI tool
- **Customization**: Since the components live in your project, you have complete control to modify them
- **Technology**: Built with React, Radix UI (for accessibility and behavior), and Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- **Philosophy**: "Copy and paste components, not packages" - giving you ownership of the code

#### Why shadcn/ui is Excellent for Your Certification

1. **Modern Approach**: Shows your understanding of current frontend development practices
2. **Accessibility**: Components follow accessibility best practices out of the box (mentioned in your certification requirements)
3. **Customization**: Allows for completely custom designs while maintaining good UX patterns
4. **Learning Value**: By having component code in your project, you can learn how well-structured components work
5. **Size Optimization**: Only include the components you actually use, reducing bundle size

#### How to Use shadcn/ui

Basic installation steps (simplified):
```bash
# Create a new Next.js project
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint

# Add shadcn/ui CLI
npx shadcn-ui@latest init

# Add components as needed
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
npx shadcn-ui@latest add card
# etc.
```

Then you can import and use the components:
```jsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Button variant="outline">Click me</Button>
  )
}
```

#### Example Component Ecosystem

For a certification project, a good selection of shadcn/ui components might include:
- Button, Card, Dialog, Dropdown Menu
- Form components (Input, Checkbox, Select)
- Tabs, Accordion
- Toast notifications

These could be styled to match your project's design while maintaining proper accessibility and behavior.

#### How shadcn/ui Compares to Traditional Libraries

| Aspect | shadcn/ui | Traditional Component Libraries |
|--------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Installation** | Copy components to your project | Install package via npm/yarn |
| **Updates** | Manual (copy new versions when needed) | Automatic via package updates |
| **Customization** | Complete (code is in your project) | Limited to provided APIs and theming |
| **Bundle Size** | Only what you use | Often includes unused components |
| **Learning** | See and modify all component code | Black box unless you read source |
| **Certification Value** | High (shows modern approach) | Medium (shows knowledge of ecosystem) |

## Web Accessibility (RGAA)

Accessibility is a critical component of modern web development and is specifically mentioned in your certification requirements (RGAA - Référentiel Général d'Amélioration de l'Accessibilité). This section provides an overview of accessibility principles and how they relate to different frameworks.

### Understanding RGAA

The RGAA is the French government's official framework for digital accessibility, aligned with international WCAG standards but adapted for French regulations. It sets requirements for making websites accessible to people with disabilities.

### Accessibility Across Frameworks

| Framework | Built-in Accessibility | Challenges | Notable Features |
|-----------|------------------------|------------|------------------|
| **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS** | Good baseline with semantic HTML | Requires manual implementation of ARIA when needed | Complete control over accessibility features |
| **Bootstrap** | Strong accessibility features | Default components generally accessible, but customizations need testing | Built-in keyboard navigation, screen reader support |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Neutral | No inherent accessibility features (it's just utility classes) | Requires deliberate implementation of accessibility |
| **React** | Neutral | JSX makes it easy to use semantic HTML, but requires attention to dynamic content | React-Aria, React Testing Library help ensure accessibility |
| **Vue.js** | Neutral | Similar to React, needs careful implementation | Vue Axe plugin can help with testing |
| **Angular** | Good | Built-in ARIA attributes for many components | Extensive a11y documentation and testing tools |

### Key Accessibility Principles for Your Certification

1. **Semantic HTML**: Always use the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose
   - Examples: `<button>` for buttons, `<nav>` for navigation, `<main>`, `<article>`, etc.

2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard
   - Tab order should be logical
   - Custom components need keyboard event handlers
   - Visible focus indicators are essential

3. **Screen Reader Support**:
   - Include alternative text for images
   - Use ARIA attributes when necessary
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver)

4. **Color and Contrast**:
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
   - Never use color alone to convey information

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - Content should be accessible at all viewport sizes
   - Text should be resizable without breaking layouts

6. **Forms**:
   - Associate labels with form controls
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Group related form elements with fieldsets

### Implementing Accessibility in Your Certification Project

For your certification, focus on these practical steps:

1. **Start with an accessibility checklist** - Use the RGAA criteria as your baseline
2. **Build with semantic HTML from the beginning** - This is the foundation of accessibility
3. **Test regularly with keyboard navigation** - Ensure you can access all features without a mouse
4. **Use accessibility browser extensions** - Tools like WAVE or axe to catch common issues
5. **Include accessibility in your documentation** - Demonstrate awareness in your project presentation

Remember that accessibility isn't just a technical requirement—it's about ensuring everyone can use your application, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. This philosophy aligns perfectly with the certification's focus on user experience.

## Conclusion

For your certification, I recommend:

1. **Focus on solid fundamentals first**: Make sure your vanilla CSS and JavaScript skills are strong.

2. **Add one framework from each category**: Consider Tailwind CSS for styling and Vue.js for interactivity (due to its easier learning curve).

3. **Prioritize user experience and accessibility**: As you noted, the certification emphasizes UX, accessibility, and modern interfaces, so focus on creating a polished, accessible frontend.

Remember that frameworks are tools to help you solve problems more efficiently, not replacements for understanding the core technologies. A developer who understands vanilla JavaScript and CSS well can learn any framework, but the reverse isn't always true.

## Industry Trends (2025 Perspective)

- **Component-based design** is now standard across all major frameworks (see glossary)
- **TypeScript** adoption continues to grow and is becoming expected knowledge
- **Server components** and similar technologies are blurring the line between frontend and backend
- **Meta-frameworks** like Next.js are increasingly becoming the standard starting point rather than bare React/Vue
- **Performance optimization** and **accessibility** are increasingly important differentiators
- **Micro-frontends** are gaining adoption in larger organizations (see glossary)

The field will continue to evolve, but investing time in learning the fundamentals and then adding framework knowledge is a sustainable approach to staying relevant in web development.

## Component-Based vs. Modular Approaches

To clarify an important distinction in web development approaches:

### Component-Based Design

**Component-based design** refers to breaking down a user interface into reusable, self-contained pieces (components) that encapsulate their own HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript behavior. This approach is fundamental to modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.

Key characteristics of component-based design:

- **Self-contained**: Components include everything they need to function
- **Reusable**: Components can be used in multiple places in an application
- **Hierarchical**: Complex components can be built from simpler components
- **Encapsulated**: Internal implementation details are hidden from other components

Contrary to potentially limiting customization, component-based design actually **enhances customization** through:

1. **Props/Parameters**: Components accept inputs that modify their appearance and behavior
2. **Composition**: Smaller components can be combined in countless ways
3. **Extension**: Base components can be extended for specialized uses
4. **Theming**: Global style variables can transform component appearance

Examples of component-based frameworks:
- React, Vue, Angular (JavaScript frameworks)
- Bootstrap, Material-UI (UI component libraries)

### Modular Approach

A **modular approach** refers to organizing code into independent, interchangeable modules that each handle a specific functionality. This can apply to both CSS and JavaScript.

Key characteristics of modular approaches:

- **Separation of concerns**: Different modules handle different aspects of functionality
- **Independent**: Modules can work independently of each other
- **Combinable**: Developers can include only the modules they need
- **Maintainable**: Changes to one module don't affect others

In CSS frameworks:
- **Component-based CSS frameworks** (like Bootstrap) provide pre-designed components with both structure and styling
- **Utility-first CSS frameworks** (like Tailwind) provide small, single-purpose utility classes to combine

### Component-Based vs. Modular: Clarifying the Difference

The confusion often stems from how these terms are used in different contexts:

| Aspect | Component-Based | Modular |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Focus** | UI building blocks | Code organization |
| **Scope** | Primarily frontend | Any software aspect |
| **Customization** | High (through props, composition) | High (through module selection) |
| **Example in CSS** | `.card`, `.navbar` components | Separate files for typography, colors, layout |
| **Example in JS** | React components | JavaScript modules for authentication, data fetching, etc. |

**Important clarification**: Component-based design and modular approaches are not opposites—they're complementary concepts that can be used together. Modern web development typically uses:

1. Component-based UI architecture (React/Vue/Angular)
2. Modular organization of code (separate files/modules for different functionality)
3. Either component-based or utility-first CSS approaches (or a mixture)

Both approaches offer extensive customization options—they just provide different ways of organizing and thinking about that customization.

### CSS-Related Terms

**CSS Preprocessor** - A program that lets you generate CSS from a syntax with additional features (e.g., Sass, LESS).

**Flexbox** - A CSS layout module designed for one-dimensional layouts (rows or columns).

**Grid** - A CSS layout system designed for two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns together).

**Media Query** - A CSS technique used for applying different styles based on the device characteristics.

**Utility-first CSS** - An approach to CSS where instead of creating semantic class names (like `.card`, `.button`), you apply many small, single-purpose utility classes directly in your HTML (like `.flex`, `.p-4`, `.text-center`, `.rounded`). This approach prioritizes composition over inheritance and abstraction. Tailwind CSS is the most popular utility-first framework.

**Atomic CSS** - Similar to utility-first, this approach uses classes that do exactly one thing (e.g., `.mt-1` for margin-top: 0.25rem), creating a larger number of smaller, reusable CSS rules rather than fewer, more specific rules. Sometimes used interchangeably with utility-first.

**BEM (Block Element Modifier)** - A CSS methodology and naming convention that organizes CSS into blocks (standalone components), elements (parts of blocks), and modifiers (variations), using class names like `.block__element--modifier`.

### JavaScript-Related Terms

**Bundler** - A tool that combines multiple JavaScript files into a single file (e.g., Webpack, Rollup).

**Callback** - A function passed as an argument to another function, to be executed when some event happens or task completes.

**ESM** - ECMAScript Modules; the official standard format for packaging JavaScript code for reuse.

**Hooks** - Functions in React that let you use state and other React features without writing classes.

**JSX** - JavaScript XML; a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML, used primarily with React.

**NPM/Yarn** - Package managers for JavaScript that automate the process of installing, updating, and removing packages.

**Promise** - An object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

**State Management** - Patterns and tools for managing application state (e.g., Redux, Vuex, Context API).

**TypeScript** - A superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions, enhancing code quality and developer experience.

### Framework-Specific Terms

**Directives** - Special attributes in Vue.js that apply behavior to rendered DOM elements.

**Hydration** - The process of attaching JavaScript event listeners to server-rendered HTML.

**Props** - Properties passed to a component (used in React, Vue, etc.).

**Redux** - A state management library commonly used with React.

**Reactive Programming** - A programming paradigm focused on data flows and the propagation of change (fundamental to Vue.js).

**Single-Page Application (SPA)** - A web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates that page as the user interacts with the app.

**Two-way Binding** - A connection between the UI and the application data model where changes in either affect the other (prominent in Angular).

### Accessibility Terms

**ARIA** - Accessible Rich Internet Applications; a set of attributes that define ways to make web content more accessible.

**A11y** - Numeronym for "accessibility" (11 letters between 'a' and 'y').

**Focus Management** - Controlling which element receives keyboard focus.

**RGAA** - Référentiel Général d'Amélioration de l'Accessibilité; the French government's accessibility standard.
